# TwitterCloneBackend

## About
The program is written in C#. I used ASP.NET Web APIs for the API and Entity Framwork and MSSQL for the database.
The goal was to create an API and a database to store and send data from the [frontend](https://github.com/Gummi95/TwitterCloneClient) of the application.
